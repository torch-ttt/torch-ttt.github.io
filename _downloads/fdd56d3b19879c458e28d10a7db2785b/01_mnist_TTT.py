TTT for Corrupted MNIST
========================

Explore how test-time training can enhance model performance on corrupted MNIST data.

In this tutorial, we will explore how the original image rotation-based `Test-Time Training (TTT) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/sun20b/sun20b.pdf>`_ approach can improve model performance during inference when the data is corrupted by Gaussian noise, using the `torch-ttt <https://github.com/nikitadurasov/torch-ttt>`_ *Engine* functionality.

This notebook is designed to demonstrate how seamlessly test-time training approaches can be integrated through `torch-ttt <https://github.com/nikitadurasov/torch-ttt>`_ into existing training and testing pipelines, while also showcasing the significant performance improvements achievable when applying TTT on corrupted or out-of-distribution data.

# Optimized Model (with TTT)
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now, let's employ the original `TTT <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/sun20b/sun20b.pdf>`_ approach to improve the performance on these noisy inputs. We will use the **TTTEngine** class, which encapsulates the mechanism of TTT's image rotation-based self-supervised loss and gradient optimization during inference.
from torch_ttt.engine.ttt_engine import TTTEngine  # noqa: E402

# %%
# 
# Test-Time Training (TTT) leverages a self-supervised auxiliary task to adapt the model to unseen data distributions during inference. In the training phase, the model is optimized jointly for the primary task and the auxiliary self-supervised task—here, image rotation prediction. This involves learning shared features through the encoder :math:`\theta_{e}` while the supervised task head :math:`\theta_{m}` (e.g. classification) and self-supervised task head :math:`\theta_{s}` (rotation angle prediction) specialize in their respective objectives.
#
# During testing, the model adapts to out-of-distribution or noisy inputs by optimizing the self-supervised loss associated with the auxiliary task, enhancing the robustness of primary task predictions. Our **TTTEngine** class seamlessly implements both the training and testing behaviors of the TTT framework, as demonstrated in the example below. For a more detailed overview of the TTT framework, please refer to the original `webpage <https://yueatsprograms.github.io/ttt/home.html>`_ and `slides <https://yueatsprograms.github.io/ttt/slides.pdf>`_.
